# RSVP Bot
RSVP Bot is a simple discord bot developed using discord.py that handles rsvp over discord servers by utilizing message reaction and direct messaging. The aim of this discord bot is to create a invite bot that has functionality of reaching out and assuring that people can attend planned events without much effort on the event planner's side.


# How to Contribute
To contribute, just create a push request and describe what changes you are making and the purpose. 
You will need to install:
- discord.py - Main library used in this project
- python-dotenv - So that you can access the bot token via the env file

I would recommend using repl.it if you have any troubles with dependencies.

# How to Test and Run
 
You will need invite this bot to a discord server so that you can test any changes you make. You can find the invite link [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=914043981107695648&permissions=421984066624&scope=bot).

The command to run the code is **python3 main.py**

# Important!

Please contact me for the bot_token. Until I can figure out how to properly upload it to github without Discord's security team reseting my bots token for doing so, I will need to give the token to you by message.
